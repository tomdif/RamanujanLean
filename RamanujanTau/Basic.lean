/-! # Ramanujan's τ function

Definition of `τ : ℕ → ℤ` as the coefficient sequence of the modular discriminant
`Δ(q) = q · ∏_{n≥1} (1 - q^n)^{24} = Σ_{n≥1} τ(n) q^n`.

## Implementation strategy

Mathlib's `Polynomial` is noncomputable (built via quotients on Finsupp).  We
therefore work with a small computable representation `Coeffs := List ℤ` —
coefficients listed low-degree-first — and define the operations needed for
the Euler product. This keeps `tau` fully reducible by `native_decide`.

The infinite Euler product `∏_{k≥1} (1 - q^k)` agrees with its truncation
`∏_{k=1}^{N} (1 - q^k)` through every coefficient of degree `≤ N` (since each
omitted factor `(1 - q^j)` for `j > N` contributes only at degrees `≥ j > N`).
So `τ(n)` is the coefficient of `q^n` in `q · (∏_{k=1}^{n} (1-q^k))^{24}`.

## Bridge to Mathlib

Mathlib has `ModularForm.discriminant : ℍ → ℂ := fun z => (eta z)^24` plus
its `q`-expansion. Connecting our `tau` to that q-expansion is a downstream
theorem (`tau_coeff_discriminant`), stated but not proved here.

Convention: `[a₀, a₁, a₂, …]` represents `a₀ + a₁·X + a₂·X² + …`.
Trailing zeros are allowed (and ignored when reading coefficients).
